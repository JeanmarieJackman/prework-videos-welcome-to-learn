# Welcome to Learn

## Learning Goals
+ Describe the difference between a Readme and Lab on Learn
+ Use the Ask a Question feature to get real-time help
+ Use the curriculum dropdown to navigate the curriculum
+ Use Learn to consume curriculum during the course

## Lesson

+ Hi guys It's Ian from Flatiron school. In this video, we're going to take a look at Learn, Flatiron School's Learning Platform for our software engineering program.
+ So our learning goals for this video are:
+  We're doing describe the difference between a README and a lab on Learn
+ We'll use the Ask-A-Question feature to get real time help
+ We'll also use the curriculum drop down to navigate the curriculum on learn
+ Also, we'll use Learn to be able to consume curriculum during this course. So by the end of this video, you should be able to do all those things.
+ So as I mentioned, Learn is Flatiron School's platform for curriculum and community
+ During your time in Flatiron school you'll use learn to consume two types of curriculum.
+ Reading material, sometimes called Readmes, are reading content that you can read through and consume on your own.
+ When you're done, you can mark the lesson completed and move on.
+ Labs are coding challenges that require you to write some code to complete
+ Each lab has an automated test suite that will tell you if your code implements the solution as required
+ Learn automatically detects when the tests are run and whether or not your code is correct.
+ We expect that you'll need to run these tests, many, many times before finishing and that's okay. This is a normal part of programming.
+ For this lab, I'm going to open it using the Open IDE button.
+ I can now run the tests by typing "learn" into my terminal.
+ And I can see the output from the failing tests.
+ You can see an overview of all the curriculum and your current track using the track navigator here.
+ You can browse ahead if you'd like to see what's coming up, but we strongly recommend that you complete the curriculum in order. Each new lesson is going to build on lessons in the previous sections, and there will be some information that you're missing out on if you skip ahead.
+ Remember that if you get stuck, that you're not alone. You can use our "Ask a Question" feature today real time support from another person.
+ Let's say that I have a question on this particular lab, I can click the "Ask a Question" button here, and type in my question into the chat.
+ Someone will respond as soon as they can and help walk me through the lab. They may ask some additional follow up questions via chat or ask me to jump onto a screen share with them to be able to work through the problem.
+ That's pretty much everything that you'll use on Learn for your course.
+ Thanks so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you in a future video. Happy coding!
