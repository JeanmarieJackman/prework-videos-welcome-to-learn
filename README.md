+ Use the curriculum dropdown to navigate the curriculum
+ Use Learn to consume curriculum during the course

## Lesson

+ Hey guys It's Ian from Flatiron school. In this video, we're going to take a look at Learn, Flatiron School's Learning Platform for our software engineering program.
+ So our learning goals for this video.
+  We're doing describe the difference between a reading and a lab on Learn
+ We'll use the Ask-A-Question feature to get real time help
+ We'll also use the curriculum drop down to navigate the curriculum and learn
+ Also, just use learning to be able to consume curriculum in this course. So by the end of this video, you should be able to do all those things.
+ So as I mentioned, learn is Flatiron School's Platform for curriculum and community
+ During your time in Flatiron school you'll use learn to consume two types of curriculum.
+ reading material, sometimes called Readmes, are reading content that you can read through and consume on your own.
+ When you're done, you can mark completed and move on to the next lesson.
+ Labs are coding challenges that require you to write some code to complete
+ Each lab has an automated test suite that will tell you if your code implements the solution as required
+ Learn automatically detects when the tests are run and whether or not your code is correct.
+ We expect that you'll need to run these tests, many, many times before finishing and that's okay. This is a normal part of programming.
+ For this lab. I'm gonna open it using the Open IDE button.
+ I can now run the tests by typing learn into my terminal.
+ And I can see that output from the failing tests.
+ You can see an overview of all the curriculum and your current track using the curriculum navigator here.
+ You can browse ahead if you'd like to see what's coming up, but we strongly recommend that you complete the curriculum in order. Each new lesson is going to build on lessons in the previously, and there will be some information that you're missing out on if you skip ahead.
+ Remember, if you get stuck, that you're not alone. You can use our ask the question feature today real time support from another person.
+ Let's say that I have a question on this particular lab, I can click the Ask a Question button here.
+ And type in my question into the chat.
+ Someone will respond as soon as they can and help me walk through the lab. They may ask some additional follow up questions via chat or asked me to jump onto a screen share with them to be able to work through it.
+ That's pretty much everything that you'll use on Learn for your course.
+ Thanks so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you in a future video.
