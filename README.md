## Outline

+ Welcome to Learn. Learn is Flatiron School's platform for curriculum and community 
+ During your time in Learn, you'll consume two types of curriculum. Reading material, sometimes called READMEs, are reading content that you can read through. When you're done, you can mark it as completed using this button.
+ Labs are mini-challenges that require you to write some code to complete. Each lab has an automated test suite that will tell you if your code implements the solution as required. Learn automatically detects when the tests are run, and whether or not your code was correct. We expect that you'll need to run these tests many, many times before finishing. That's ok - this is a normal part of programming.
+ You can view an overview of all of the curriculum in your current track using the Curriculum Navigator. You can browse ahead if you like, but we strongly recommend that you complete the curriculum in order.
+ Remember that if you get stuck, you're not alone. You can use the Ask a Question feature to get real-time support from another person.
